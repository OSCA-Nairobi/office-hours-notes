# office-hours-notes
This will include what is discussed and covered during the office hours sessions

## November 30th 
On the 30th of November, we had Segun Olumide, and Alemoh Rapheal Baja introduce us to API documentation and what it entails.

We started off by getting an introduction to what APIs are(Application Programming Interface,  is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other), then an overview of the structure of the API docs.

What to know before documentation:

- What do you want to achieve on the docs

- Who is the target audience

Plan -> Research -> Draft -> Review -> Publish 

You can iterate depending on the improvements in the API and newer ways to improve the documentation.

The brief format includes:

- Introduce what the API does

- Get the user started by including tutorials and guides on the different formats used

- Add examples to the calls, responses, and error handling

Something to note is to be consistent with the style being used; you can come up with one or use existing ones.
